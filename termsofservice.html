    <p>Simple Guidelines for Our Electrician Services</p>
  </header>

  <div class="container">
    <section>
      <h2>1. Booking a Service</h2>
      <p>Customers can contact us by phone, WhatsApp, or through our website to book an electrician. Once booked, we will confirm your date and time. For urgent issues, we try our best to send someone quickly.</p>
      <p>Please make sure someone is at home to let our team in. If you need to reschedule, inform us at least 24 hours before the appointment.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Pricing and Payment</h2>
      <p>We believe in honest pricing. Our charges depend on the type of work, time required, and materials used. You will receive a price estimate before we start the job.</p>
      <p>Payments can be made in cash, through UPI, or via bank transfer once the job is completed. We do not ask for advance payment unless special parts are required.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Safety and Quality</h2>
      <p>Your safety is important to us. All our electricians follow safety rules and use proper tools. We only use high-quality wires, switches, and other parts to make sure everything works well and lasts long.</p>
      <p>If you face any issue after our service, let us know. We offer a free check-up within 30 days for work done by our team.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Cancellations and Delays</h2>
      <p>If you cancel a booking less than 24 hours before the scheduled time, a small cancellation fee may be applied. If our electrician is delayed due to traffic or an emergency, we will inform you as soon as possible.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Customer Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>Customers must provide a safe and clean work area. Please inform us if there are pets, elderly persons, or children at the location so we can take proper care while working.</p>
      <p>Do not ask our electricians to perform tasks outside electrical work, such as carpentry or plumbing.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Service Warranty</h2>
      <p>We provide a 30-day service warranty on all repairs and installations. If something stops working within this time, we will visit and fix it at no extra cost (as long as it wasn't damaged by misuse or other external reasons).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Respect and Behaviour</h2>
      <p>We treat our customers with respect and expect the same in return. Any form of abuse or inappropriate behavior towards our staff will result in immediate cancellation of service.</p>
